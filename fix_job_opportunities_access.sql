-- Fix Job Opportunities Access
-- This script ensures job opportunities are publicly readable

-- 1. Enable RLS on job_opportunities table
ALTER TABLE public.job_opportunities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view active job opportunities" ON public.job_opportunities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read active jobs" ON public.job_opportunities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage job opportunities" ON public.job_opportunities;

-- 3. Create policy for PUBLIC READ access to active jobs
CREATE POLICY "Public can read active job opportunities"
ON public.job_opportunities
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (is_active = true);

-- 4. Create policy for authenticated users to see all jobs
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view all jobs"
ON public.job_opportunities
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- 5. Create policy for admins to manage jobs
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage job opportunities"
ON public.job_opportunities
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.users
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
    AND users.role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.users
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
    AND users.role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
  )
);

-- 6. Verify the table structure
SELECT 
  'job_opportunities table structure:' as info,
  column_name, 
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'job_opportunities'
  AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 7. Check current job count
SELECT 
  'Current job statistics:' as info,
  COUNT(*) as total_jobs,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_active = true) as active_jobs,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_active = false) as inactive_jobs
FROM public.job_opportunities;

-- 8. OPTIONAL: Add sample job opportunities (uncomment if you want sample data)
