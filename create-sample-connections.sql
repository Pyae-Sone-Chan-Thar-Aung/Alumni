-- ===================================================================
-- NEXT STEPS:
-- ===================================================================
-- 1. Go to your application's Messages page
-- 2. Click on "Compose" 
-- 3. You should now see recipients in the "To:" dropdown
-- 4. Select a recipient and send a test message
-- 5. Check the "Inbox" to see received messages
-- 6. Test the full messaging workflow
