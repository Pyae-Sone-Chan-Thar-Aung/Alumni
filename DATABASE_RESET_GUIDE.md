## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "is_admin() function does not exist"

**Solution**: You must run `FRESH_DATABASE_COMPLETE.sql` BEFORE creating storage buckets. The function is created by that script.

### Problem: "relation does not exist" errors

**Solution**: Make sure you ran `FRESH_DATABASE_COMPLETE.sql` successfully. Check for any error messages in the SQL output.

### Problem: Images not uploading

**Solution**: 
1. Verify storage buckets exist
2. Check bucket policies are configured correctly
3. Verify bucket is set to "Public"
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

### Problem: Registration not working

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `users` table exists
3. Check that `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in `.env`
4. Restart your React app after `.env` changes

### Problem: Admin features not accessible

**Solution**:
1. Verify you're logged in with an admin account
2. Check your email is in the admin list:
   ```sql
   SELECT email, role, approval_status FROM public.users WHERE role = 'admin';
   ```
3. If not admin, manually promote yourself:
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.users 
   SET role = 'admin', approval_status = 'approved', is_verified = true
   WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

## üìù Notes

- **RLS is disabled on `users` table** - This is intentional to allow registration without authentication
- **Pre-configured admin emails** - Only specific emails are auto-promoted to admin
- **Storage policies cannot be created via SQL** - Must use Supabase Dashboard UI
- **Backup before reset** - There's no undo button!

---

## üöÄ Quick Command Reference

### Test if database is clean:
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public') as tables,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public') as policies;
```

### Test if is_admin() works:
```sql
SELECT public.is_admin(auth.uid()) as am_i_admin;
```

### List all admin users:
```sql
SELECT id, email, first_name, last_name, role, approval_status 
FROM public.users 
WHERE role = 'admin';
```

### Promote user to admin:
```sql
UPDATE public.users 
SET role = 'admin', approval_status = 'approved', is_verified = true, approved_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```
