# Part IV: Deployment and Maintenance

## Part IV: Deployment

### Introduction to Deployment

Deployment is the process of making a software application available for use in a production environment. For the CCS Alumni Portal, deployment involves multiple considerations including infrastructure setup, data migration, user training, and system monitoring. Different deployment approaches have varying implications for risk, downtime, and resource requirements.

**Deployment Approaches Overview:**

| Approach | Description | Risk Level | Downtime | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------|------------|
| **Big Bang** | Complete system replacement at once | High | High | Low |
| **Phased** | Gradual rollout by modules/users | Medium | Low | Medium |
| **Parallel** | Run old and new systems simultaneously | Low | None | High |
| **A/B Testing** | Deploy to subset of users for testing | Low | None | Medium |

### 10.1 Deployment Strategy

#### Chosen Strategy: Phased Deployment with Parallel Testing

**Deployment Approach:** Phased deployment with parallel testing for critical components, followed by gradual user migration.

**Justification:**

1. **Risk Mitigation:** Phased approach reduces risk by allowing early detection of issues with limited user impact
2. **User Adaptation:** Gradual rollout allows for user training and feedback incorporation
3. **System Stability:** Parallel testing ensures data integrity and system reliability
4. **Resource Management:** Manageable workload for IT support team during transition
5. **Rollback Capability:** Easy to revert specific phases if issues arise

pm2 start ccs-alumni-portal
```

**Level 3: Full System Rollback (30-60 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Activate maintenance mode
echo "System under maintenance" > /var/www/maintenance.html
nginx -s reload

# 2. Stop all services
pm2 stop all
sudo systemctl stop ollama
sudo systemctl stop nginx

# 3. Restore complete system backup
cd /var/www/
rm -rf ccs-alumni-portal/
tar -xzf backups/full-system-backup-v1.0.0.tar.gz
