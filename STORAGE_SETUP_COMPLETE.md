# ✅ Storage Buckets Setup - COMPLETE

## 🎉 What We've Done

### 1. ✅ Created SQL Script
- **File:** `STORAGE_BUCKETS_SETUP.sql`
- **Status:** Successfully executed ✅
- Created 6 storage buckets with proper configurations
- Created ~26 RLS policies for complete access control
- Added verification queries

### 2. ✅ Updated Frontend Code
The following files have been updated to use the correct bucket names:

#### Profile Image Uploads:
- ✅ `src/pages/AlumniProfile.js` - Updated to use `profiles` bucket with `{user_id}/` structure

- ✅ `src/pages/Profile.js` - Updated to use `profiles` bucket with `{user_id}/` structure

#### Gallery:
- ✅ `src/components/gallery/AdminGallery.js` - Already correctly using `gallery` bucket

### 3. ✅ Created Documentation
- ✅ `STORAGE_BUCKETS_STRATEGY.md` - Comprehensive strategy document
- ✅ `STORAGE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Developer reference guide with code examples
- ✅ `STORAGE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

## 🧪 What to Test Now

### Immediate Testing (Required):

1. **Profile Image Upload (High Priority)**
   - ✅ Go to Register page and upload a profile image
   - ✅ Go to Profile/AlumniProfile page and update profile image
   - ✅ Verify images appear correctly
   - ✅ Check that images are stored in `profiles/{user_id}/` folder

2. **Gallery Management (High Priority)**
   - ✅ Admin: Create a new album with cover image
   - ✅ Admin: Upload multiple photos to the album
   - ✅ Public: View gallery albums and images
   - ✅ Verify images load correctly

3. **Access Control Testing (Critical)**
   - ✅ As regular user: Try to upload to `profiles` bucket (should work)
   - ✅ As regular user: Try to access another user's profile folder (should fail)
   - ✅ As admin: Try to access all buckets (should work)
   - ✅ As anonymous user: Try to view public images (should work)
   - ✅ As anonymous user: Try to upload (should fail)

### Optional Testing (Can be added later):

4. **News Images (Not Yet Implemented)**
   - Need to add image upload functionality to `AdminNews.js`
   - See `STORAGE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for example code

5. **Job Logos (Not Yet Implemented)**
   - Need to add logo upload functionality to `AdminJobs.js`
   - See `STORAGE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for example code

6. **Tracer Study Documents (Not Yet Implemented)**
   - Need to add document upload functionality to `TracerStudy.js`
   - See `STORAGE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` for example code

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Do This Now):
1. ✅ **Test profile image uploads** - Register a new user with an image
2. ✅ **Test gallery uploads** - Create an album as admin
3. ✅ **Verify access control** - Make sure users can only access their own files
4. ✅ **Check Supabase Dashboard** - Go to Storage section and verify all 6 buckets exist

### Short Term (This Week):
5. **Add News Image Upload** - Implement image upload in `AdminNews.js`
6. **Add Job Logo Upload** - Implement logo upload in `AdminJobs.js`
7. **Monitor Storage Usage** - Check storage metrics in Supabase dashboard

### Long Term (Optional):
8. **Add Tracer Study Documents** - Allow users to upload supporting documents
9. **Add Registration Verification Docs** - Allow users to upload ID/certificates during registration
10. **Optimize Images** - Add image compression/resizing before upload
11. **Add Progress Indicators** - Show upload progress for large files

## 🔒 Security Summary

### Public Buckets (Readable by Anyone):
- ✅ `profiles` - Profile images are public for display
- ✅ `news` - News images are public
- ✅ `gallery` - Gallery photos are public
- ✅ `jobs` - Job logos are public

**Note:** Even though these buckets are "public", RLS policies still control who can UPLOAD/DELETE files.

### Private Buckets (Owner + Admin Only):
- 🔒 `registration-documents` - Only owner and admins can read
- 🔒 `tracer-study-documents` - Only owner and admins can read

---

## 📊 Verification

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify everything:

```sql
-- Check all buckets exist
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit 
FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id IN (
    'profiles',
    'registration-documents',
    'news',
    'gallery',
    'jobs',
    'tracer-study-documents'
);

-- Count policies per bucket
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%profiles%' THEN 'profiles'
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%registration%' THEN 'registration-documents'
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%news%' THEN 'news'
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%gallery%' THEN 'gallery'
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%jobs%' THEN 'jobs'
        WHEN policyname LIKE '%tracer%' THEN 'tracer-study-documents'
        ELSE 'other'
    END as bucket,
    COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage'
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket;
```

Expected results:
- 6 buckets found ✅
- ~26 total policies ✅
- Each bucket has 2-6 policies ✅

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Policy violation" error when uploading
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the correct folder structure: `{user_id}/filename`

### Issue: "Bucket not found"
**Solution:** Verify the bucket name spelling matches exactly (no typos!)

### Issue: Profile images not showing
**Solution:** 
1. Check if the `profile_image_url` is saved in `user_profiles` table
2. Verify the bucket is set to `public: true`
3. Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue: Upload works but can't see the file
**Solution:**
1. Check if you have a SELECT policy for that bucket
2. Verify you're using the correct `getPublicUrl()` method
3. Check the file actually exists in Storage dashboard
