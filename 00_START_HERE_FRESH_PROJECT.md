## 🗂️ Database Structure Overview

Your database will have **9 tables**:

### Core Tables
1. **users** - Authentication and user management
2. **user_profiles** - Extended alumni information
3. **pending_registrations** - Approval workflow queue

### Content Tables
4. **news** - News articles and announcements
5. **gallery_albums** - Photo album collections
6. **gallery_images** - Individual photos

### Feature Tables
7. **job_opportunities** - Job board postings
8. **tracer_study_responses** - Career tracking data
9. **batchmate_messages** - Alumni messaging

### Relationships Configured

```
users (parent)
  ├─→ user_profiles (CASCADE delete)
  ├─→ pending_registrations.reviewed_by (SET NULL)
  ├─→ news.author_id (SET NULL)
  ├─→ gallery_albums.created_by (SET NULL)
  ├─→ gallery_images.uploaded_by (SET NULL)
  ├─→ job_opportunities.posted_by (SET NULL)
  ├─→ tracer_study_responses.user_id (CASCADE delete)
  └─→ batchmate_messages (CASCADE delete)

gallery_albums (parent)
  └─→ gallery_images.album_id (CASCADE delete)
```

**What this means**:
- Deleting a user automatically deletes their profile
- Deleting a user automatically deletes their tracer study data
- Deleting an album automatically deletes all its photos
- Content created by deleted users has author set to NULL (preserved)

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why CASCADE delete for profiles?
- Profile data has no meaning without the user
- Keeps database clean
- Prevents orphaned records

### Why SET NULL for content?
- Preserves historical content
- Maintains content integrity
- Shows "Created by: [Deleted User]" in UI

### Why public buckets?
- Alumni profiles should be visible to all
- Gallery photos should be public
- News images should be accessible
- Still controlled by upload permissions

### Why RLS on all tables?
- Defense in depth
- Protects against SQL injection
- Enforces business rules at database level
- Even if application has bugs, database is secure

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Service Role Key Security
- **NEVER commit to git**
- **NEVER expose to frontend**
- **Only use in backend server**
- **Rotate if accidentally exposed**

### Database Connections
- Frontend uses **anon key** (safe to expose)
- Backend uses **service_role key** (keep secret)
- RLS policies enforce security even with anon key

### Storage Buckets
- **Must be PUBLIC** for images to display
- Security controlled by RLS policies
- Authenticated users can upload
- Everyone can view

---
