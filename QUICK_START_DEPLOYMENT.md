4. Create Policy #1 (Public Read):
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Public Access"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   USING ( bucket_id = 'alumni-profiles' );
   ```
   
5. Create Policy #2 (Authenticated Upload):
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (
     bucket_id = 'alumni-profiles' AND
     auth.role() = 'authenticated'
   );
   ```

6. Create Policy #3 (Update Own Files):
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own images"
   ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
   USING (
     bucket_id = 'alumni-profiles' AND
     auth.role() = 'authenticated'
   );
   ```

**For `gallery-images` and `news-images` buckets:**

Follow same process but use these policies:

```sql
-- Policy 1: Public Read
CREATE POLICY "Public Access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING ( bucket_id = 'gallery-images' ); -- or 'news-images'

-- Policy 2: Admin Upload
CREATE POLICY "Admins can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'gallery-images' AND -- or 'news-images'
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.users
    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Policy 3: Admin Update/Delete
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'gallery-images' AND -- or 'news-images'
  EXISTS (

    WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

    approval_status = 'approved', 
    is_verified = true,
    approved_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'your-email@uic.edu.ph';
```

4. Verify it worked:
```sql
SELECT email, role, approval_status

## üêõ Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: "relation does not exist" error
**Fix**: Run `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql` again

### Problem: Profile image upload fails
**Fix**: Check bucket name is `alumni-profiles` in code and exists in Dashboard

### Problem: Can't login after registration
**Fix**: Check approval_status in database, should be 'approved' for test users

### Problem: Admin dashboard shows all zeros
**Fix**: Make sure you've:
1. Registered at least one user
2. Submitted at least one tracer study
3. Logged in as admin user

### Problem: Storage policy errors
**Fix**: Delete all policies for that bucket and recreate them one by one
