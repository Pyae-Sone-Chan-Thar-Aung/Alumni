# CCS Alumni Chatbot Guide

## Overview
The CCS Alumni chatbot has been redesigned to follow the NUS CFG (Centre for Future-ready Graduates) model, featuring guided conversations instead of free-form AI chat. The chatbot is named **Jaguar** (the CCS mascot) and uses the system's pink theme (#e91e63) for a cohesive brand experience. This approach ensures more accurate, privacy-conscious, and user-friendly interactions.

## Key Features

### 1. **Guided Conversation Flow**
- Button-based interactions (no free-text input)
- Predefined conversation paths
- Clear, structured responses
- Easy navigation with "Go back" options

### 2. **User Type Selection**
When users open the chatbot, they first identify themselves:
- **Student**: Access system navigation, features, and alumni career insights
- **Alumni**: Get help with profile updates, networking, job opportunities, and events
- **Employer**: Learn about posting jobs and finding CCS graduates
- **Staff**: Access admin features, reports, and user management help

### 3. **Privacy Protection**
Built-in safeguards to protect user data:
- No personal information disclosure about other users
- Aggregated data only (employment statistics, not individual salaries)
- Privacy reminders in networking features
- Restricted access to sensitive information

### 4. **Context-Aware Navigation Assistance**
The chatbot helps users:
- Navigate the system efficiently
- Understand available features
- Find specific pages and functions
- Learn about system capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **No Ollama dependency**: Removed AI model requirements
- **State-based conversations**: Uses React state management
- **Predefined responses**: All content is hardcoded for accuracy
- **Button interactions only**: No text input field

### Key Components

#### Chatbot.js
```javascript
// Main state variables
- conversationState: Tracks current position in conversation flow
- userType: Stores selected user type (student/alumni/employer/staff)
- messages: Array of conversation messages with options
- unreadCount: Notification badge counter
```

#### Chatbot.css
- Clean, modern styling inspired by NUS CFG
- Blue color scheme (#0066cc)
- Rounded message bubbles
- Hover effects on buttons
- Responsive design for mobile

### Data Privacy Implementation

```javascript
const isPrivacyViolation = (query) => {
  const privacyKeywords = [
    'password', 'email of', 'phone number of', 'address of',
    'personal data', 'other user', 'salary of', 'contact info'
  ];
  return privacyKeywords.some(keyword => 
    query.toLowerCase().includes(keyword)
  );
};
```

## Content Guidelines

### Response Structure
Each response includes:
1. **Clear heading** with emoji for visual appeal
2. **Bullet points** for easy scanning
3. **Action items** when applicable
4. **Privacy notices** where relevant
5. **Follow-up options** as buttons

### Example Response
```
ðŸ’¼ **Job Opportunities:**

Access the **Job Board** to:
â€¢ Browse current job openings
â€¢ Filter by industry, location, or job type
â€¢ Save jobs to your favorites
â€¢ Apply directly through the system

New opportunities are posted regularly by employers and the CCS admin team.
```
