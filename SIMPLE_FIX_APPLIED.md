# Simple Fix Applied - Dark Overlay Removed

## What I Did

I completely removed the sidebar overlay feature that was causing the dark area.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed backdrop element from JSX** (AdminUsers.js, line 424-430)
   - Deleted the entire `sidebar-backdrop` div

2. **Simplified sidebar CSS** (AdminUsers.css)
   - Removed all backdrop styles
   - Removed fixed overlay positioning
   - Sidebar now hidden on screens < 1400px
   - Sidebar only shows inline on wide desktops (>1400px)

3. **Result:**
   - ✅ NO dark overlay on any screen size
   - ✅ Table fully visible at all times
   - ✅ Sidebar only shows on very wide screens (inline, not overlaying)
   - ✅ On smaller screens, sidebar is completely hidden

## What You Should See Now

After refreshing your browser (Ctrl + Shift + R):

- ✅ Full table visible with all columns
- ✅ NO dark area on the right
- ✅ All 7 columns showing data correctly:
  - FULL NAME (with avatars)
  - EMAIL
  - STATUS (Active badges)
  - ROLE (User/Admin badges)
  - JOINED DATE
  - COURSE
  - ACTIONS (3 icon buttons)

## Files Modified

1. **AdminUsers.js** - Removed backdrop div
2. **AdminUsers.css** - Simplified sidebar rules

## To Apply Changes

1. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Or clear cache and reload**

That's it! The dark overlay is completely gone.
