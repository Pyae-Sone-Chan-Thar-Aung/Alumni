## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Fix Database Schema Issues

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Navigate to your project: `sgalzbhfpydwnvprxrln.supabase.co`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Create a new query

3. **Execute the Database Fix Script**
   - Copy the entire contents of `targeted-database-fixes.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL editor
   - Click "RUN" to execute

   This script will:
   - Add missing `published` columns to `news` and `gallery_albums` tables
   - Add missing `survey_year` column to `tracer_study_responses` table
   - Create all 4 required storage buckets
   - Fix RLS policies to allow registration
   - Set up proper storage policies

### Step 2: Verify Fixes

1. **Run the Test Script**
   ```bash
   node test-all-features.js
   ```

   You should see a much higher pass rate (90%+) after the fixes.

### Step 3: Build and Deploy

1. **Automated Fix and Build** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   fix-and-deploy.bat
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## 🔍 What Each Fix Does

### Database Schema Fixes
```sql
-- Adds missing published column to news table
ALTER TABLE news ADD COLUMN published BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- Adds missing published column to gallery_albums table  
ALTER TABLE gallery_albums ADD COLUMN published BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- Adds missing survey_year column to tracer_study_responses table
ALTER TABLE tracer_study_responses ADD COLUMN survey_year INTEGER DEFAULT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE);
```

### Storage Bucket Creation
Creates 4 essential storage buckets:
- `alumni-profiles` (5MB, public) - Profile images
- `gallery-images` (10MB, public) - Photo gallery
- `news-images` (5MB, public) - News article images  
- `documents` (10MB, private) - Official documents

### RLS Policy Fixes
- Allows anonymous users to submit registration forms
- Enables public access to published content
- Maintains security for admin-only operations

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option A: Local Testing
```bash
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Option B: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag and drop the `build` folder
4. Set environment variables in site settings:
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
